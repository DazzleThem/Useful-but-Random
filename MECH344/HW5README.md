HW5 contains two sections that solves different problems applying to 1D, convective transfer heat exchange across a plate.


Section 1 solves for theta*, the ratio of temperature differences between any T and T initial. 
  INPUTS 7
    Fo = Fourier number
    Bi = Biot number
    Eg1 = eigenvalue obtained from literature corresponding to Bi
    Eg2 = eigenvalue obtained from literature corresponding to Bi
    Eg3 = eigenvalue obtained from literature corresponding to Bi
    Eg4 = eigenvalue obtained from literature corresponding to Bi
    x = non-dimensionalized location in x direction
    
  OUTPUTS 1 
  Theta = the ratio of temperature differences
  
  Section 2 graphs temperature over the plate with x = 0 at the midline of the plate.
