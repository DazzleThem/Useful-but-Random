Mohr's Circle is a program that graphs all possible shear and normal stresses for a section. Tau xy is read, "shear stress on the x face in the y direction." Note that tau xy and tau yx will have the same magnitude and are given the same variable name. 
The equations are from Mech 231 aka Solids at Colorado State University in spring 2019. 

INPUTS 3
   sigmaxx = the value of normal stress in the x direction on the x face
   sigmayy = the value of normal stress in the y direction on the y face
   tauxy = the value of shear stress in the x or y direction on the x or y face
DEFAULTS 1
  t = theta and is always in degrees from 0 to 180
